## Prediction routes

The canonical page routes are `/predict` and `/predict/:symbol` with the current
language prefix. SDK navigation still emits legacy `/prediction` hrefs;
the host navigation adapter maps them to `/predict`. Old direct links redirect
to the canonical page while preserving the encoded symbol, query, and hash.
Entries without a language prefix use the existing locale selection.

Orderly SDK dependencies are pinned to `3.3.1`.
